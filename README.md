Exp.1_behavData contains all behavioural data from experiment 1: manipulation of the cholinergic system with rivastigmine.

Exp.1_behavData contains all behavioural data from experiment 2: manipulation of the serotonergic system with Citalopram.

Exp.3_behavData contains data from 'medium' offer trials in the poor environment (Khalighinejad et al., Neuron, 2020) and the rich environment (experiment 3).

All the linear mixed-effect models (LMEM) used to analyse data are explained in detail in Online Methods: GLM1.1, GLM1.2, GLM1.3, GLM2.1, GLM4.1
