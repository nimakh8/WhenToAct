# WhenToAct
Behavioural data for "Complementary roles of cholinergic and serotonergic systems in decisions about when to act"

Exp.1_behavData contains data from 'medium' offer trials in the 'balanced' design (Khalighinejad et al., Neuron, 2020) and the 'biased' design (experiment 1).

Exp.2_behavData contains all behavioural data from experiment 2: manipulation of the serotonergic system with Citalopram.

Exp.3_behavData contains all behavioural data from experiment 3: manipulation of the cholinergic system with rivastigmine.

All the linear mixed-effect models (LMEM) used to analyse data are explained in detail in Online Methods: GLM1.1, GLM1.2, GLM3.1, GLM3.2, GLM3.3
